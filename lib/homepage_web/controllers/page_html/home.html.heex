  Hi, my name is **RÃ¼diger Diedrich** and this is my homepage.

  For the last couple of years I am a big proponent of the Elixir and
  Erlang/OTP ecosystem: be it projects like Phoenix framework which 
  bends the rules of traditional client-server-based web development
  or Livebook - built on top of Phoenix - which for me is simply the
  next generation of interactive notebooks and completely changed
  the way I go about prototyping and data analysis.
  
  Check out some of the projects I've been working on.
